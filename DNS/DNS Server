Technically, there is nothing such as a DNS server. It is an umbrella term for different types of servers in the DNS system. Here's a breakdown:

1. Root DNS Servers: These are the starting point of the DNS hierarchy. They store information about the authoritative DNS servers for top-level domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, .net, etc.

2. Top-Level Domain (TLD) DNS Servers: These servers hold information about the authoritative DNS servers for each TLD.

3. Authoritative DNS Servers:These servers store the actual DNS records (such as A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, etc.) for specific domain names.

4. Recursive DNS Servers: Also known as DNS resolvers, these servers handle requests from clients (like your computer or smartphone) by recursively querying other DNS servers until they find the IP address associated with a domain name.

5. Caching DNS Servers: These servers temporarily store DNS records to speed up subsequent requests and reduce the load on authoritative DNS servers.

As for which servers ISPs and domain registrars typically have:

- ISPs: They typically provide recursive DNS servers for their customers to resolve domain names. These servers might also cache DNS records to improve performance.

- Domain Registrars (like GoDaddy and Namecheap): They often offer authoritative DNS hosting services, allowing customers to manage DNS records for their domain names. Additionally, they might provide recursive DNS services as well.

So, while ISPs mainly offer recursive DNS services, domain registrars primarily provide authoritative DNS services, although some, like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS, offer both.
