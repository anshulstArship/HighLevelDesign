 Domain names and IP addresses:
* A machine is identified by an IP address, but it's easier to remember a domain name. You can think of a domain name as a nickname for an IP address
* ICAAN is the organization that manages domain names and IP addresses. You can buy a domain name from a domain registrar like GoDaddy or Namecheap.
* DNS servers are responsible for mapping domain names to IP addresses. When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer asks a DNS server 
   for the IP address of the domain name.

🌐 Scalability
* As the number of users and data grows, the system should be able to handle the increased load. This is called scalability.
* Vertical scaling is when you add more resources to a single machine, like adding more RAM or CPU. Horizontal scaling is when you add more machines to your system.
* Vertical scaling has a limit, so most systems use horizontal scaling. Horizontal scaling distributes the load across multiple machines, which makes the system
   more capable of handling increased load.

📡 Load Balancers:
* Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This helps to avoid overloading a single server. A load balancer can also detect when a 
   server is down and stop sending traffic to it.
* Load balancers reverse proxy the incoming requests to the servers. This means that the servers don't see the IP address of the client, they only see the IP address
   of the load balancer. They distribute the requests based on a load balancing algorithm like round-robin, least connections, or IP hash.
* Load balancers use health checks or heartbeats to detect when a server is down. When a server is down, the load balancer stops sending traffic to it.

💾 Sharding:
* Data sharding is a technique used to split a large database into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. Each shard is stored on a separate server.
* Shard keys are used to determine which shard a piece of data should be stored on.
* You can use a hash function to determine which shard a piece of data should be stored on.
